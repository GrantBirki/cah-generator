# Used to generate individual CAH files

The code that runs this script is `script/generator.py`

## Example

```
php generator.php 'batch-id=cards&card-text=test&card-color=white&icon=none'

php generator.php 'batch-id=cards&card-text=A large, African-American gentleman named Richard.&card-color=white&icon=none'



CAH-Generator
=============

Uses imagemagick to create Cards Against Humanity images for printing on actual cards through a print studio.

Originally I'd planned on generating the entire card on the fly. However, my lack of imagemagick acumen, combined with how CPU intensive the process is for the shitty host I have this hosted on made that infeasable. So I start with the cards as fully formed as I can, and simply add the text. The font file is ommited, because it's not a free font, and I don't have the rights to distribute it.

You can see it in action at:

For those interested in making their own card images from scratch, 'notes.rtf' has the closest I have to something you can use to recreate the steps I took. Every time I tried something new that I felt I might want to reference back to, I threw it in there. It's by no means complete, will probably frustrate you more than help you, and I apologize in advance for not caring.
