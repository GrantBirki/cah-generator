## Editing Cards üìù

The first step you need to do before generating your cards is editing or creating them!

- Edit one line at a time seperated by a new line in the `cards/` directory
- `black.txt` controls the black cards to generate
- `white.txt` controls the white cards to generate
- `info.txt` controls meta data about the deck (e.g. the name of the deck, version, etc)

> Note: Whether you use the `single-card-output` or `multi-card-output` option, the card data will both be pulled from the `cards/` folder. Each method has different formatting options so keep that in mind. If you want to do something crazy with your cards you will likely lock yourself into the `multi-card-output` option. If you want a very basic deck that is easily printable, you will need to keep your cards very simple and go with the `single-card-output` option.

> Note: for apostrophes, use `‚Äô`

### Custom Card attributes

Here are a few quick custom card attributes that you can add to your cards:

- `{{1}}` - Ads the `custom_img_1` to a card
- `{{2}}` - Ads the `custom_img_2` to a card ... etc
- `[[gears]]` - Ads the `gears` image to a card
- `[[2]]` - Ads the `draw 2` image to a card
- `[[3]]` - Ads the `draw 2 pick 3` image to a card

### About `info.txt`

An example of the `cards/info.txt` looks like the content below:

```text
name = Beans Against Humanity
short_name = BAH
version = 1
custom_img_1 = bean.png
custom_img_2 = bean.png
custom_img_3 = bean.png
custom_img_4 = bean.png
custom_img_5 = bean.png
```

In this case, the custom deck will have the following:

- `Beans Against Humanity` as the name instead of `Cards Against Humanity`
- `BAH` as the identifier instead of `CAH` (not used in the `single-card-output` generator)
- `1` as the game deck version

> All the the `custom_img_*` values are specific to the `single-card-output` generator. These files are stored in the `generator/single-card-output/custom_img/` folder. They **must** be simple black and white images

Note: If you are using the `make single-card-output` and do **not** want to use the info file, set all the values to `none` in the text file like so:

  ```text
  none
  none
  none
  ```

> Important: Make sure your `info.txt` files does not have an ending new line

## Generating Cards ‚öôÔ∏è

There are two methods in this repo that are used to generate cards. Both options can be found the in `generators/` folder

- **Option #1**: Generate all cards as individual image files (aka `generators/single-card-output/` code)

  This is the ideal option for printing cards since many websites need you to individually upload each card that you want to print

  ```bash
  make single-card-output
  ```

- **Option #2**: Generate all the cards into a single PDF file (aka `generators/multi-card-output/` code)

  This is the *quick and dirty* option. It actually provides the most flexibility with editing cards as the Ruby code for doing so is quite robust. It provides fancy symbols, custom card icons, special fonts, and much more. However, it is going to be a pain to get the mashed together PDF professionally printed. You can always take this PDF to a printing store, print it out, and cut the cards on your own.

  ```bash
  make multi-card-output
  ```

Both options will output your cards into the `output/` folder in their respective directories.

## Single-Card Output Info

To generate a single image for each card (think 1:1 ration of cards to files) then use the `single-card-output` option. This is **the easiest option** if you wish to print your cards professionally via a printing company!

```console
$ make multi-card-output

## Multi-Card Output Info

This section contains details on how to use the code in the `generators/multi-card-output/` folder

### Usage (docker) üê≥

To use the generator, simply run the following command: `make run`

```console
$ make multi-card-output
Creating ruby ... done
Attaching to generator
generator    | Generated: output/cards.pdf
generator    | Done!
```

Once this command completes, your `cards.pdf` file can be found in the `output/` directory.

### Usage (ruby) üíé

To use the generator in Ruby run the following commands:

**Bootstrap the repo:**

```bash
script/bootstrap
```

**Generate the cards:**

```bash
script/generate -d cards/ -l -o output
```

Once this command completes, your `cards.pdf` file can be found in the `output/` directory.

## Introduction

**CAH Generator** is a card generator for the game [_Cards Against Humanity_](https://cardsagainsthumanity.com/), a party game for horrible people.

This generator enables you to:
* Generate cards using various formats and styles (more information below).
* Include your own CAH game. For example, if your game is a CAH fork called ***Ysabel Against Humanity***, you can have your own watermark!
* Include game version.
* Automatic PICK and DRAW for black cards.
* Special cards.

## Use

You need to have **Ruby** installed, at least 2.5. Then you can, from your console:

```
ruby generator.rb
```

By default, a help message will be displayed. Follow the instructions for more.

## Generator features

The generator works using three files:
* `white.txt`, the white cards file.
* `black.txt`, the black cards file.
* `info.txt`, the game info file, where you can specify the name of your game and, optionally, the game version.

### Info file

If the info file is available, the generator will introduce your game name in every card. Refer to the help text for more information on this file's format.

### White and black cards

Each card must be in one line. Zero-length lines will be ignored, but lines containing spaces will be turned into blank cards.

Inserting `((_))` on any line will generate a special card, that has as icon the character `_` (i.e., for _warning_ cards, put `((!))`).

The generator has **PICK 2 and PICK 3 detection**, but you can manually insert them by adding `[[2]]` or `[[3]]` at the beggining or the end of the line.

Card text can be **formatted** using HTML-like tags. The supported tags are:

- `<b></b>` - bold text
- `<i></i>` - italic text
- `<u></u>` - underlined text
- `<strikethrough></strikethrough>` - strikethrough text
- `<sub></sub>` - subscript text
- `<sup></sup>` - superscript text
- `<br>` - line break
- `<color rgb=\"#0000ff\"></color>` - set text color
- `<font name=\"Font Name\"></font>` - set text font

### Card sizes

You can specify different card sizes:

* **Large:** cards of size 2.5" x 3.5"
* **Small:** cards of size 2" x 2"
