<h1 align="center"><p align="center">CAH Generator</h1></h1>

<p align="center">
  A custom Cards Against Humanity generator specifically designed around having your cards professionally printed
</p>

## Turbo Quick Start ‚≠ê

Generating your own custom CAH deck:

1. Make sure all the cards you want to generate are up-to-date in the `cards/deck_<#>` folder
2. Run `script/deck --deck=#` (the number of the deck you want to generate)
3. Your deck zip will be placed in the `decks/` folder

### Creating a new deck

Need to create a new deck? No problem! Just run `script/deck --create=#` (the number of the deck you want to create)

From here you can now edit the `.txt` files in the `cards/deck_<#>` folder to add your own cards.

## Editing Cards üìù

Here is some brief info on creating your own cards:

- Edit one line at a time seperated by a new line in the `cards/deck_#/` directory
- `black.txt` controls the black cards to generate
- `white.txt` controls the white cards to generate
- `info.txt` controls meta data about the deck (e.g. the name of the deck, version, etc)

> Usable double quotes: `‚Äú‚Äù`

### Custom Card attributes

Here are a few quick custom card attributes that you can add to your cards:

- `{{1}}` - Ads the `custom_img_1` to a card
- `{{2}}` - Ads the `custom_img_2` to a card ... etc
- `[[gears]]` - Ads the `gears` image to a card
- `[[2]]` - Ads the `draw 2` image to a card
- `[[3]]` - Ads the `draw 2 pick 3` image to a card

> Note: to add a custom card image, drop the image file into the `generators/single-card-output/custom_img/` folder

### About `info.txt`

An example of the `cards/info.txt` looks like the content below:

```text
name = Beans Against Humanity
short_name = BAH
version = 1
custom_img_1 = bean.png
custom_img_2 = bean.png
custom_img_3 = bean.png
custom_img_4 = bean.png
custom_img_5 = bean.png
```

In this case, the custom deck will have the following:

- `Beans Against Humanity` as the name instead of `Cards Against Humanity`
- `BAH` as the identifier instead of `CAH`
- `1` as the game deck version

Note: If you do **not** want to use the info file, set all the values to `none` in the text file like so:

  ```text
  none
  none
  none
  ```

> Important: Make sure your `info.txt` files does not have an ending new line

## Generating Cards ‚öôÔ∏è

- Generate all cards as individual image files (aka `generators/single-card-output/` code)

  This is the ideal option for printing cards since many websites need you to individually upload each card that you want to print

  ```text
  script/deck --create=#
  ```

## Note about the code

This code is unbelievably hacky, gross, and terrible.. but it works.

## Introduction

**CAH Generator** is a card generator for the game [_Cards Against Humanity_](https://cardsagainsthumanity.com/), a party game for horrible people.

This generator enables you to:
* Generate cards using various formats and styles (more information below).
* Include your own CAH game. For example, if your game is a CAH fork called ***Ysabel Against Humanity***, you can have your own watermark!
* Include game version.
* Automatic PICK and DRAW for black cards.
* Special cards.

## Use

You need to have **Ruby** installed, at least 2.5. Then you can, from your console:

```
ruby generator.rb
```

By default, a help message will be displayed. Follow the instructions for more.

## Generator features

The generator works using three files:
* `white.txt`, the white cards file.
* `black.txt`, the black cards file.
* `info.txt`, the game info file, where you can specify the name of your game and, optionally, the game version.

### Info file

If the info file is available, the generator will introduce your game name in every card. Refer to the help text for more information on this file's format.

### White and black cards

Each card must be in one line. Zero-length lines will be ignored, but lines containing spaces will be turned into blank cards.

Inserting `((_))` on any line will generate a special card, that has as icon the character `_` (i.e., for _warning_ cards, put `((!))`).

The generator has **PICK 2 and PICK 3 detection**, but you can manually insert them by adding `[[2]]` or `[[3]]` at the beggining or the end of the line.

Card text can be **formatted** using HTML-like tags. The supported tags are:

- `<b></b>` - bold text
- `<i></i>` - italic text
- `<u></u>` - underlined text
- `<strikethrough></strikethrough>` - strikethrough text
- `<sub></sub>` - subscript text
- `<sup></sup>` - superscript text
- `<br>` - line break
- `<color rgb=\"#0000ff\"></color>` - set text color
- `<font name=\"Font Name\"></font>` - set text font

### Card sizes

You can specify different card sizes:

* **Large:** cards of size 2.5" x 3.5"
* **Small:** cards of size 2" x 2"
